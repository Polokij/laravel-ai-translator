# Target String
The most important mission: All strings should be translated into {targetLanguage} from {sourceLanguage}.
- Source Language: `{sourceLanguage}`
- Target Language: `{targetLanguage}`
- Source filename: `{filename}`

## Context
- Parent key (Only for your reference, don't put to the key): `{parentKey}`
- The source strings: (e.g. `key`: """(value)"""), these are the strings that you should translate into the target language.
{strings}
