# Target Definition
The most important mission: All strings should be translated into {targetLanguage} from {sourceLanguage}.
- Source Language: `{sourceLanguage}`
- Target Language: `{targetLanguage}`
- Source filename: `{filename}`

# Content
- Parent key (Only for your reference, don't put to the key): `{parentKey}`
- To make sure, the keys you should translate are: `{keys}`
- [CRITICAL] Sometimes key has double quotes, 'â€™', '"', '{', '}', ':' or other special characters. You should keep them in the translation.
- These are the strings that you should translate into the target language. The source strings: (e.g. `key`: """(value)""")
{strings}
